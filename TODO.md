This is an exploration of `raylib` and `Perlin Noise`.
I mostly get it so I'm putting this asside (for now).

# Improvements

- [ ] there's an off by 1/2 error causing dots to ont draw on last row/col
- [ ] speed up rendering
- [ ] grid debugger / visualizer mode
- [ ] add Mr. Perlin's original gradient table instead of randomizing

# Features

- [ ] add an `imgui` menu to play with config live
- [ ] draw something 3d (terain / perlin cloud)
- [ ] generalize the perlin crate for ND (or just add a 3d variant)
- [ ] add some different ways of shifting the gradient (time / offset)
